# Opening the network in Cytoscape #
####################################

You should have Cytoscape to fully access our network files. [Download](https://cytoscape.org) and install the application, if you have not already.

To open the network in Cytoscape, you can do one of the following:

### Opening the session file directly

Simply open `ORnet.cys`. If the network opens and looks good, you are ready to explore!

If this does not work for any reason, you can follow the instructions below to import from the source files.

### Importing network data and styles separately

1. Open Cytoscape. (If you do not have one already, you should  and install it first.)

2. Import network data by selecting from the top menu bar:

	File > Import > Network > File > Open `ORnet.cyjs`.

	At this point, you already have all network data. Follow the next steps to also import our customized node/edge styles for visualization.

3. Import styles by selecting from the top menu bar:

	File > Import > Styles > Open `styles-ORnet-custom.xml`.

4. Go to "Styles" tab in the Control Panel.

	The Control Panel is usually on the left side of the Cytoscape window. The Styles tab is usually between the Network tab and the Select tab. Click Styles.

5. Click the drop-down menu under Styles (the current style setting may read "default"), and select "ORnet-custom".

6. Your network should look exactly as beautiful as ours in the paper. Explore!
